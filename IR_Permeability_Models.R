### Exercise 6.1:

# (a) Start R and use these commands to load the data:
library(caret)
data(tecator) # use ?tecator to see more details

# (b) In this example the predictors are the measurements at the individual
# frequencies. Because the frequencies lie in a systematic order (850â€“1,050 nm),
# the predictors have a high degree of correlation. Hence, the data lie in a
# smaller dimension than the total number of predictors (215). Use PCA
# to determine the effective dimension of these data. What is the effective
# dimension?
